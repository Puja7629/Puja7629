Personal attributes that I believe make me suitable for this position include:

â€¢	Adaptive Learner:- Since, Whatever I have learned till now, I have done it on my own, so I believe that even if I lack some of the technologies that your project demands, I am keen and confident in getting it by hand in record time.
